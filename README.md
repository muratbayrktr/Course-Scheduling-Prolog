# Course-Scheduling-Prolog

This project aims to solve the course-scheduling problem using Answer Set Programming (ASP) with Clingo. It utilizes the following code files:

- `timetabling.lp`: This file contains the ASP program that solves the course-scheduling problem.
- `extract_facts.py`: This Python script is used to extract relevant data and generate facts for the ASP program.
- `tabularize_v2.py`: This Python script is used to visualize the generated schedule as an Excel file.

## An Example of the Optimized Schedule

The following is an example of the optimized schedule generated by the ASP program:

![Optimized Schedule]("demo.png")

## Usage

1. Run `extract_facts.py` to extract data and generate the necessary facts for the course-scheduling problem. This will generate files such as `timeslots.lp` and `busy.lp`.
2. Run `clingo timetabling.lp occupies.lp timeslots.lp busy.lp` to solve the course-scheduling problem using Clingo.
3. Run `tabularize_v2.py` to visualize the generated schedule as an Excel file.

## Dependencies

- Clingo: The ASP solver used to solve the course-scheduling problem.
- Python: The programming language used for data extraction and visualization.
